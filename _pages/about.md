I am a PhD student of [Pierre Peterlongo](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Pierre.Peterlongo/) and [Tatiana Starikovskaya](https://starikovskaya.github.io/homepage/) working in the [Genscale Team](https://team.inria.fr/genscale/) at Inria Rennes and in the [Talgo Team](https://www.di.ens.fr/TalgoTeam.html.en) at École normale supérieure, France. I am interested in algorithms on strings, compact data structures and hashing algorithms. I also enjoy implementing algorithms, especially the ones with applications to biology.

# Volunteer work

[Girls Can Code!](https://gcc.prologin.org/) is an student organization promoting programming and Computer Science to girls via summer camps and 2-days workshops, founded in 2014.
Since 2014, more than 300 girls participated in the events organized by Girls Can Code!

I have been an organizer and teacher of those summer camps since 2016. I was vice-president in 2018-2019.

[Prologin](https://prologin.org/) is a student organization that organizes a contest for french speakers under 20 years old. It aims at gathering young computer enthusiasts to meet and compete with one another.

I have been organizing, writing algortithmic problems and written exams since 2018. I was vice-president in 2018-2019.
